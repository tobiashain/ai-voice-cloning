# AI Voice Cloning

> **Note** This project has been in dire need of being rewritten from the ground up for some time. Apologies for any crust from my rather spaghetti code.

This [repo](https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/ai-voice-cloning)/[rentry](https://rentry.org/AI-Voice-Cloning/) aims to serve as both a foolproof guide for setting up AI voice cloning tools for legitimate, local use on Windows/Linux, as well as a stepping stone for anons that genuinely want to play around with [TorToiSe](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts).

>\>Ugh... why bother when I can just abuse 11.AI?

You're more than welcome to, but TorToiSe is shaping up to be a very promising tool, especially with finetuning now on the horizon.

This is not endorsed by [neonbjb](https://github.com/neonbjb/). I do not expect this to run into any ethical issues, as it seems (like me), this is mostly for making funny haha vidya characters say funny lines.
